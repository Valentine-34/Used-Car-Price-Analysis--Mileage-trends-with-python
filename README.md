This is a python project that focuses on cleaning, exploring and analysing a dataset (used_cars_sales.csv) 
that has data on used cars from 2018 to 2020. Utilized python to analyse the dataset to gain insights on whether mileage
affected the price at which a used car was sold. In the analysis part of the project, some visualization tools such as scatter plots, pie charts
and bar charts were used.
